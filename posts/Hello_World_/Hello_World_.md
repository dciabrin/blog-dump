I'm opening this blog to share my bits of code, hacks or thoughts I have
during the time I spend in front of my computer. That will be a great
occasion for me to retrieve all the goodies laying in my attic and that
I should take the time to package cleanly! Moreover, that will be a good
way of talking about the cool things I work on nowadays... Okay, I
know... it sounds so vague... but hey, it's only a Hello World after all
:)
